### Content
#### Skills
  - To modify the skills displayed in about section, go to [skills](https://github.com/alifirst01/my-personal-website/tree/master/src/assets/skills) directory under src/assets directory and create a new json file with name value pairs specifying different skills. The name of the file will show up as the heading in about section and all skills specified inside that file will be listed under the heading. The proficiency level of a skill is determined by its value - ranging from 0 to 100.
  - In order to change the image displayed alongside each skill, go to the [Skills icons](https://github.com/alifirst01/my-personal-website/tree/master/src/assets/images/skills-icons) under src/assets/images directory and create a .png file of that skill. The name of the .png file should be the exact same as the skillname in order for it to get displayed alongside that skill.
